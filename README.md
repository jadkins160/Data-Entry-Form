Hello, welcome to my submission form application. This app was built mainly with Vue in VS Code, with HTML, JavaScript and CSS. Deploy the code within VS Code and type 'npm install' then 'npm run dev' inside the terminal for the app to then be opened up inside your local port/browser window. 

For the time being, the submission form is only one page, but I plan on expanding the form so when the user submits their information, they're then taken to a confirmation page where all previous users' information is then listed in addition to the newly added user information.

Thanks!
